"""A tensor supporting reduction over irregularly grouped entries.

A segmented tensor is a tensor with a set of indices {0, ..., num_segments - 1}
and an index map that assigns an index to each element of the tensor. Two
elements with the same index are considered grouped together. The set of all
elements with index `k` is called the segment over k.

Segmented tensors support reductions over segments (reduce_mean, reduce_sum,
etc.). A typical example is performing reductions over table cells:

```
# Prepare a tf.Tensor with table values.
values = ...

# Prepare the table indices, either by rows or columns. The shape of `row_ids`
# and `col_ids` has to be a prefix of the shape of `values`.
row_index = segmented_tensor.IndexMap(indices=row_ids, num_segments=max_rows)
col_index = segmented_tensor.IndexMap(indices=col_ids, num_segments=max_cols)

# Combine the indices to get a table indexed by cell. The result has
# `num_segments` equal to row_ids * col_ids.
cell_index = segmented_tensor.ProductIndexMap(row_index, col_index)

# Compute the averages per cell. The result is a `Tensor` with shape
# [max_rows * max_cols, ..] together with an index map on it. The index map is
# equal to range(max_rows * max_cols).
cell_averages, _ = segmented_tensor.reduce_mean(values, cell_index)

# Gather the results to get back a Tensor with the same shape as `cell_index`.
# If there are multiple elements in the same cell they will have the same value.
token_to_its_cell_average = segmented_tensor.gather(cell_averages, cell_index)
```

Batching is supported by setting `batch_dims`. The first `batch_dims` dimensions
will be treated as the batch. Elements of different batches are never grouped
together, not even if they have the same index.
